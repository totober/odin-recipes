            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>STEP 1 <br>
                    Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.<br>
                    Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.<br>
                    Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth.<br>
                    Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p</li>
                <li><p>STEP 2 <br>
                    Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste.<br>
                    Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
                <li><p>STEP 3<br>
                    Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls.<br>
                    On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin.<br>
                    The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven.<br>
                    Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p></li>
                <li><p>STEP 4<br>
                    Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.<br>
                    Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf.<br>
                    Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.<br>
                    Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.<br>
                    Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray.<br>
                    Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.<br>
                    Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using.<br>
                    Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p></li>
