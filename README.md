# odin-recipes

Well, i have to write an introduction of the project and what kind of skills i want to develop through it.
The project is about building a webpage with html (only that, for now). The content consists in a couple of recipes of meals that i like.

Regarding the skills, i hope im going to be able to practice html, git, github and of course my writing in english. As the project progress, more tools are going to join it, like CSS and JS. The goal is to practice those skills step by step, getting deeper in each iteration.
